Did not have much time to add additional functionalities to it. But I think the promary requirements been fullfilled.

I have used Laravel plarform to perform the task. At first the data been inserted by reading the Json file provided. Otherwise its not possible to find out which tasks been completed already.

The file extension check for only image file was not implemented as lack of time. But atleast check for file is there.
