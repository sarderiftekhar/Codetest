Codetest
Please pull the files from the repository.

Steps to follow:

1) Composer install
2) Create the database name 'codetest' into the local server. (Set it up accordingly in the .env file)
3) Create or copy .env file
4) Generate key
5) Run Migrate ( to create the tables)
6) db:seed to populate the data by reading the Json file
7) Artisan serve to run the project

Did not have much time to add additional functionalities to it. But I think the promary requirements been fullfilled.

I have used Laravel plarform to perform the task. At first the data been inserted by reading the Json file provided. Otherwise its not possible to find out which tasks been completed already.

The file extension check for only image file was not implemented as lack of time. But atleast file exist is there.

Thanks
